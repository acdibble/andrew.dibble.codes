      h1 Howdy.

      p My name is Andrew Dibble, and I am a software engineer.
      p In the past, I've worked in German parliament, in a law office, as a heavy equipment
        |  operator, and even as a Sandwich Artist at Subway. I hold a Bachelor of Science in
        |  German and International Business from Canisius College in Buffalo. But in 2017, I
        |  decided top finally take the plunge and jump head first into my new career.
      p I live in Austin, TX, but I originally am from the Buffalo, NY area. I moved here to pursue
        |  a career in software engineering, attending an advanced software engineering immersive
        |  program before ultimately landing a job as a software engineer at Malauzai Software,
        |  Inc., an Austin-based start up which was recently acquired by Finastra, the third
        |  largest fintech company in the world.
      p At Malauzai, I work behind the scenes as a back-end engineer, ensuring your money gets to
        |  where you want it to be. Othwerwise, you'll find me playing games, avoiding the
        |  scorching summer, and attempting to keep up on new techs and learning some old ones.
        |  Feel free to reach out to me via the contact page or connect with me on the social
        |  media in the footer.
