      p My name is Andrew Dibble, and I am a software engineer.
      p In the past, I've worked in German parliament, in a law office, as a heavy equipment
        |  operator, and even as a Sandwich Artist at Subway. I hold a Bachelor of Science in
        |  German and International Business from Canisius College in Buffalo. Currently, however,
        |  I am a software engineer who specializes in Node.JS based out of Berlin, Germany.
      p Although I have worked most extensively with the Node.JS runtime, I prefer to think of
        |  myself as language agnostic. I like to research and find the best tools for the task at
        |  hand as well as dabble in different technologies and languages and see what they have to
        |  offer
      p As such, I've worked with web frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Elixir and Phoenix,
        |  databases like PostgreSQL (and other flavors of SQL) and MongoDB (which stores my
        |  projects in the projects section), various cloud service providers to varying degrees,
        |  various front-end JS libraries, and, to a more limited extent, some native frameworks
        |  and languages.
      p Outside of tech, I like to read comedic fiction and poetry, attempt to finally learn an
        |  instrument, ride motorcycles, and play the occasional video game or two.
